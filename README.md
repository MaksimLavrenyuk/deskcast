Deskcast is an application for screen broadcasts from your computer to any device within your local network.

You can easily show your PC screen on Smart TV televisions and projectors during meetings.
Let's finally forget about connecting the wire from the TV/projector to the laptop!

The application uses webRTC, so some devices (TVs with old Smart TVs) may not process the stream correctly.
The app works within your local network specifically for security purposes.
